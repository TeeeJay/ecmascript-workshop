# ECMAScript Workshop

The next-generation of javascript also known as ECMAScript 6 (also called ES6 or Harmony), 
is bringing us lots of amazing features that you probably will need to know, like:
* classes
* modules
* arrow functions (todo)
* template strings (todo)
* constants, variables and scoping (todo)
* promises (todo)

## Sugar Syntax

First of all, Syntactic Sugar is a syntax that make a language easier to understand and more readable, it makes the language "sweeter" for us. 
It also means that some "new" features of ES6 are not really new because ES6 is trying to simplify the syntax to make things easier for us. 
So instead of writing the your code using the old tricky way, you'll be able to code in a the simpler way, with sugar syntax.

## Installation
