# Calculator example

To get this application up run 'npm run start' from command line in the workshop directory
Go to localhost:8090/ in your browser to see the calculator application.

This is a small Javascript application taken from http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/javascript-css3-calculator.

Try to use some of the new ES6 functionality that you have learned and rewrite/add some ES6 features.

## What can be improved?
* Use let/const instead of var
* Separate some of the functionality into classes/modules
* What about arrow functions?
* Some tests can also be written. (look at the existing ones for inspiration)

## New calculator functionality
* Implement a modulo function
