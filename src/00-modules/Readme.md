# Modules

ECMAScript 6 have built-in support for modules (no more global namespace pollution).

There is exactly one module per file and one file per module. 

By default anything you declare in a file is not available outside that file. 

## Named export/import

Export functionality (classes, functions, variables, constants) from a module.

There can be multiple named exports:

```
export var myVar1 = ...;
export let myVar2 = ...;
export const MY_CONST = ...;
export function myFunc() {}
export class MyClass {}
```

You can list everything you want to export at the end of the module 
(which is once again similar in style to the revealing module pattern):

```
const MY_CONST = ...;
function myFunc() {}
export { MY_CONST, myFunc };
```

You can also export things under different names:

```
export { MY_CONST as THE_CONST, myFunc as theFunc };
```

How to import named exports:

```
import { myFunc, myVar1 } from 'src/mylib';
import { myFunc as awesomeFunc, myVar1 } from 'src/mylib';
```

You can also import the complete module (using a wildcard):

```
import * as lib from 'src/mylib';
console.log(lib.square(11));
console.log(lib.diag(4, 3));
```

Once you import a value you can also re-export it!

## Default export/import

You may also specify a single default exported value as a convenient shortcut,  
by simply naming the exported value "default".
 
Examples:

```
export default 123;
export default function (x) {
    return x
};
export default x => x;
export default class {
    constructor(x, y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
};
```

To import a module's default export omit the curly braces in the import statement:

```
import theDefault from 'src/mylib';
import theDefault, { named1, named2 } from 'src/mylib';
```

## Code task 1 - export two named functions

In `src/00-modules/named.js` create and export two named functions:
* sum, a function that add two numbers
* multiply, a function that multiply two numbers

## Code task 2 - export two functions by default

In `src/00-modules/default.js` export two functions by default:
* sum, a function that add two numbers
* multiply, a function that multiply two numbers

By the way! I hope you see that it's the same two functions as in the previous task,
maybe you don't have to write them again?
