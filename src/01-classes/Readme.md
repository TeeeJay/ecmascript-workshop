# Classes

JavaScript classes (ECMAScript 6) provide a much simpler and clearer syntax to create objects and deal with inheritance.

## Syntactic Sugar

Classes aren't really 'classes', instead they are functions which are in turn objects

It’s important to understand that while JavaScript is an object-oriented language, it is prototype-based (objects inherit from other objects) and does not implement a traditional class system.

## Prerequisite: Understanding JavaScript Objects

Almost everything in JavaScript are objects (including functions and arrays), except for primitives:
* numbers
* boolean
* strings
* null
* undefined

An object is a collection of properties, 
and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. 
A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. 

The easiest way to create an object in JavaScript is like this:

```
let myObject = {
  'key1': "Awesome",
  'key2': "Object"
}
```

Or:

```
var myObject = Object.create(new Object());
myObject.key1 = "Awesome";
myObject.key2 = "Object";
```

Or:

```
function MyObject(value1, value2) {
  this.key1 = value1;
  this.key2 = value2;
}
var myObject = new MyObject("Awesome", "Object");
```

Here 'key1' and 'key2' are properties of the object. 

To access a property of an object, we use `object.property`, for example:

```
console.log(myObject.key1); 
```

You can also create properties on an object, like this:

```
myObject["property"] = "Value";
```

That syntax, by the way, is functionally equivalent to this syntax:
```
myObject.property = "Value";
```

The object does also have some inherited methods since 
almost all objects eventually inherit from `Object` in JavaScript and so they inherit its methods.

To invoke a method of an object, we use object.method(), for example :

```
myObject.toString();
```

To find out if a property exists on an object (either as an inherited or an own property), 
you use the in operator:

```
console.log('key1' in myObject); // true
```

## Object-oriented programming in ECMAScript 5

In ECMAScript 5 we have always been able to create JavaScript classes like this:

```
function MyClass (id) {
     var privateField = "My secret";
     // Instance properties
     this.id = id;
}

// Prototype methods are shared across all instances of the class
MyClass.prototype.myMethod = function () {};

// Create a new instance (object) with the MyClass() constructor.
var instance1 = new MyClass(1);
var instance2 = new MyClass(2);

instance1.myMethod();
instance1.id; // 1
instance2.myMethod();
instance2.id; // 2
instance1 instanceof MyClass; // true
```

Objects have inherited properties and own properties:
```
newObj1.hasOwnProperty('myMethod') // false
newObj1.hasOwnProperty('id') // true
```
The own properties are properties that were defined on the instance, 
while the inherited properties were inherited from the Function’s Prototype object.

### Why is MyClass a function, shouldn’t it be a class?

MyClass is a constructor function, and combined with the new keyword, work together to create new objects in much in the same way classes do in other OO languages.

When you create an object using the new keyword, it creates a new object, passes it in as this to the constructor function.

### Prototype

A prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties.

When you define a function within JavaScript, 
it comes with a few pre-defined properties and one of these is the illusive prototype:
* The prototype property is initially an empty object.
* The prototype property is used primarily for inheritance. 
When an object is constructed, it inherits all of the properties of its constructor’s prototype.
* You can add methods and properties on a function’s prototype property 
to make those methods and properties available to instances of that function.
The implications for performance and maintenance are obvious and significant. 
Methods that inherit via the prototype chain can be changed universally for all instances.

### How does prototype inheritance work?

Every object in JavaScript has a special related object called the prototype.

```
vehicle.__proto__ = machine
// machine is the prototype of vehicle

car.__proto__ = vehicle
// vehicle is the prototype of car
```

This is a prototype chain: car -> vehicle -> machine

When looking up a property, Javascript will try to find the property in the object itself. If it does not find it then it tries in it's prototype, and so on.

### Subclasses

A class can have subclasses that can inherit all or some of the characteristics of the class.

```
// Child class constructor
function MySubClass() {
  MyClass.call(this);
}

// Inherit from the parent class
MySubClass.prototype = Object.create(MyClass.prototype);
MySubClass.prototype.constructor = MySubClass;

// Child class method
MySubClass.prototype.myMethod = function() {
  MyClass.prototype.method.call(this);
}

```

This is not very easy to read!

### Static methods

```
function MyClass () {}

// A static method that only exists on the class and doesn't exist on derived classes
MyClass.myStaticMethod = function() { 
	console.log('hello'); 
};

MyClass.myStaticMethod(); 
```

## Object-oriented programming in ECMAScript 6

### Class Definition

One way to define a class in ECMAScript 6 is using a class declaration.

ECMAScript 6 provides the `class` keyword and `compact method notation` as syntactic sugar for writing a
function and assigning methods to its prototype.

```
class MyClass {
    constructor (id) {
        this.id = id
    }
    myMethod () {}
}
let instance = new MyClass(1);
instance instanceof MyClass; // true
typeof MyClass // 'function' (old-school constructor function)
instance.hasOwnProperty("myMethod"); // false
MyClass.prototype.myMethod(); // It is still prototype-based!
```

The body of a class is the part that is in curly brackets {}.
This is where you define class members, such as methods or constructors.

This is the prototype chain: MyClass -> Object

### Subclasses

The extends keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class with a child of another class.

```
class MySubClass extends MyClass {
    constructor (id) {
        super(id)
    }
}
```

A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of a parent class.

This is the prototype chain: MySubClass -> MyClass -> Object

## Static methods

The static keyword defines a static method for a class.
Static methods are called without instantiating their class and are also not callable when the class is instantiated.
Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application.

```
class MyClass {
    constructor (id, x, y) {
        this.id = id
    }
    static staticMethod() {}
}
console.log(MyClass.staticMethod());
```

## Getters and setters

class MyClass {
    get prop() {
        return 'getter';
    }
    set prop(value) {
        console.log('setter: '+value);
    }
}

You use getters and setters as follows:
```
> let instance = new MyClass();
> instance.prop = 123;
setter: 123
> instance.prop
'getter' 
```

## Code task 3 - create class 

Create a class equal to the ECMAScript 5 code:

```
function Point(x,y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
}

// Static method
Point.distance = function (a, b) {
    var dx = a.x - b.x;
    var dy = a.y - b.y;
    return Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
};

Point.prototype.toString = function () {
    return this.x + ' ' + this.y;
};

module.exports = Point;
```

## Code task 4 - class inheritance

Extend the Point class from previous task 
so that it behaves equal to the ECMAScript 5 code below:

```
// Child class constructor
var ColorPoint = function (x, y, color) {
    Point.call(this, x, y);
    this.color = color || 'red';
};

// Inherit from the parent class
ColorPoint.prototype = Object.create(Point.prototype);
ColorPoint.prototype.constructor = ColorPoint;

// Child class method
ColorPoint.prototype.getColor = function () {
    return this.color;
};
module.exports = ColorPoint;
```

By the way, ECMAScript 6 support default values for function parameters.
```
function myFunction(x=1337) {}

```
