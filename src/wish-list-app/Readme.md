# Wish list app

Here is a simple wishlist app based on a todo app from http://code-maven.com/todo-in-html-and-javascript.

Santa started making a wish list app so that everyone can write down their Christmas wishes.
He has not gotten very far on making it, so he needs your help!

You will find the app in `src/wish-list-app`. You can run it up by:
* run `npm start` from this directory
* navigate to `localhost:8090` in your browser

Santa will also be happy if you can improve it for him.
He did not use ES 2015, so he was hoping you at least could update the ES5 features to use ES2015.

You need to fix the app so that you can write down your wishes for Christmas, or else it will only be socks for you :/

## Possible improvements
* Use let/const instead of var
* Separate some of the functionality into classes/modules
* What about arrow functions?
* Some tests can also be written. (look at the existing ones for inspiration)
* Feel free to juice it up with some CSS styling

## Additional functionality
* Make it possible to also give a number to each wish to order the wishes.
* Ensure that no duplicates exist.
